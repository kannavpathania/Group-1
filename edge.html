        <h1>About microsoft edge</h1>
        <h3>
Microsoft Edge (codename "Spartan") is a web browser developed by Microsoft and included in Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile and Xbox One, replacing Internet Explorer as the default web browser on all device classes. According to Microsoft, it is designed to be a lightweight web browser with a layout engine built around web standards.[11] It has new features, including integration with Cortana, annotation tools, and a reading mode.[12]
            </h3>
        <h3>
Edge does not support ActiveX or Browser Helper Objects of Internet Explorer. Browser extension support was developed and added in preview builds in March 2016, and released with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update on August 2, 2016. Microsoft Edge extensions are distributed via Microsoft Store.</h3>
        <h1>
Microsoft Edge advantages</h1>
        <h3>
Microsoft Edge comes with high speed , Speed is one of the most important aspects to consider when you’re deciding which browser should become your default choice , According to Microsoft , Microsoft Edge is the fastest browser on the market .
            </h3>
<h3>
Microsoft Edge is an app rather than a system program , It will be the default browser for both PC and mobile versions of Windows 10 , replacing Internet Explorer 11 , As it sports its own rendering engine, it is unlikely that it will ever appear on iOS or Android devices .</h3>
<h3>
Edge has a neat Reading List mode tucked away in its minimalist UI , Reading List function syncs content between the devices , To add an item , you can click the favorite icon in the toolbar and choose to add it to your reading list rather than to a bookmarks folder , Reading-list-edge has been moved front adn center , you can get a similar service using apps and add-ons like Pocket for a long time .</h3>
        <h1>
Microsoft Edge disadvantages</h1>
        <h3>
Microsoft Edge does not have Extension Support , no extensions means no mainstream adoption , The one reason you probably won’t make Edge your default browser , You will really miss your extensions , There is lack of full control , An easy option to switch between search engines is missing as well .
            </h3>
        <h3>
Microsoft Edge does not have address bar , When you open a new Tab Page in Microsoft Edge , the address bar is removed from the browser UI and all you get is a “Where to next” field on the page which acts as a combined search field and address bar , The address bar appears if you scroll down on the new tab page , and if you do , you cannot scroll up anymore to display the in-page “where to next” field instead .</h3>
        <h3>
When you select Settings from the main menu at the top , you will notice that Settings are displayed as a fly-out menu in Microsoft Edge , The Settings don’t use the available browser window , When you can click on the pin icon to display the Settings permanently on the screen , that takes away space from the websites that you open in the browser .
