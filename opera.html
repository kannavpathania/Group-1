        <h1> About Opera</h1>
        <h3>
Opera Mini is a mobile web browser developed by the Opera Software AS company. It was primarily designed for the Java ME platform, as a low-end sibling for Opera Mobile, but it is now developed exclusively for Android and iOS. It was previously developed for Windows 10 mobile, Windows Phone 8.1, BlackBerry, and Symbian. Those versions are still maintained, despite not being developed.
</h3>
        <h3>
Opera Mini was derived from the Opera web browser. Opera Mini requests web pages through Opera Software's compression proxy server.
    </h3>

In July 2012, Opera Software reported that Opera Mini had 168.8 million users as of March 2012.[17] In February 2013, Opera reported 300 million unique Opera Mini active users and 150 billion page views served during that month. This represented an increase of 25 million users from September 2012.[18]On 3 September 2014, Opera started taking registrations for the beta version of Opera Mini for Windows Phone.[44] Opera Mini was released for Windows Phone six days later, on 9 September 2014, as a public beta.[45] This marked Opera's return to Microsoft's mobile platform since the demise of Windows Mobile.
