        <h1>About firefox</h1>
        <h3>
            The Mozilla Firefox project was created by Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross as an experimental branch of the Mozilla browser.</h3>
<h1>Release date</h1>
        <h3>
Firefox 1.0 was released on November 9, 2004, Firefox 1.5 was released on November 29, 2005, and version 2.0 was released on October 24, 2006. Firefox 3.0 was released on June 17, 2008, with version 3.5 and version 3.6 released on June 30, 2009 and January 21, 2010, respectively. Version 4.0 was released on March 22, 2011. Since the version 5.0, a rapid release cycle was put into effect, resulting in a new major version release every six weeks on Tuesday.</h3>

        <h1>Lastest version</h1>
        <h3>
The latest version, Firefox 57.0, was released on November 14, 2017.
            </h3>
        <h1>
            Advantage:<br/></h1>
 <h2>Security</h2>
        <h3>
Firefox has been at the forefront of Web browser security, introducing numerous features that protect you from phishing schemes, viruses and other common exploits. </h3>
 <h3>Firefox security can be greatly enhanced with extensions like NoScript and FlashBlock that enable you to selectively execute advanced code on websites.</h3>
 <h2>Extensions and Themes</h2>
        <h3>
Firefox is one of the most easily customized browsers with support for browser extensions, plugins and themes that fundamentally alter the function and appearance of the browser to best suit your needs.</h3>
        
        <h3>
As of June 2011, the Firefox Add-ons library features more than 6,000 extensions and more than 500 themes.</h3>
        <h3>
 Extensions are capable of performing everything from providing access to your Facebook wall from the Firefox toolbar, keeping tabs on your Gmail and alerting you of breaking news to altering website elements with scripts, consolidating the Firefox interface and much more.</h3>
        <h1>
            Disadvantage:<br/></h1>
        <h2>
 Compatibility</h2>
        <h3>
Internet Explorer has a distinct advantage over Firefox in that it can run ActiveX controls that allow you to interact with the Windows operating system and programs like Microsoft Office. Those websites that utilize ActiveX controls to enable deeper Windows integration, among them many of the most used business websites, are incompatible with Firefox.</h3>
        <h2>
Resource Usage</h2>
        <h3>
Mozilla Firefox is often among the most resource-intensive Web browsers when it is compared to other Web browsers in independent testing. While browser start-up times and RAM usage have improved with each successive release of Firefox, the installation of extensions often negates those improvements as the code used in extensions is not always the most efficient.
